              <b>We're</b> a fantastic local, independent, not for profit, all women's sports
              team with a significant audience that's well know for doing highly visibile
              philanthropic work.

            p.hidden-sm.hidden-xs.
              <b>You're</b> a business that's motivated to cultivate a positive image in the
              community and leverage smart opportunities for advertising to grow.

            p.
              You understand that you're signing up to be a sponsor for the 2014 season
              and that the benefits of doing so only apply to 2014. You understand
              that the benefits will start on March 1, 2014 or as soon as your
              application has been approved by the Clarksville Roller Derby board
              of directors and your contribution has been received.

            p.
              Finally, you understand that we're derby girls, not copy writers or
              graphic designers.  You will be responsible for providing any copy
              and graphics to be used for advertising purposes.
